## Releases

Never use em dashes in user-facing writing, including release titles, release
notes, and agent responses. Use commas, colons, parentheses, or full stops.

Do not cut a release for every fix. Work accumulates on the default branch
until there is something substantial to announce: a feature, or a batch of
fixes worth a changelog entry. The exception is a regression in something just
released, which goes out as soon as it is fixed.

Before writing release notes, read the repository's previous two stable
releases and match their style:

- Start with a short plain-language summary, followed by a download line when
  the project ships binaries.
- Include screenshots or short videos of the main user-visible changes.
  Capture only synthetic demo content, never real user data. Host the media
  where earlier releases do, such as release assets or files beside the notes.
- Use `New` and `Fixed` sections as applicable, and `Known limitations` when
  there are any. Lead each item with a bold user-facing result and credit who
  did what with issue or pull request numbers ("By @x; thanks @y"),
  acknowledging reporters separately from implementers.
- Include a `Thanks` section listing contributors and reporters, and end with
  `**Full changelog**:` and a link comparing the previous tag.
- Write about what changed for the user, not the commit history. Describe
  known limitations honestly.

Commit the notes as `packaging/release-notes/vX.Y.Z.md`, or in the
repository's existing release-notes location, before tagging, and have the
release workflow publish that file as the release description (for example
softprops/action-gh-release with `body_path` and
`generate_release_notes: false`). Never leave GitHub's generated notes in
place. After publishing, verify every media and download link.
