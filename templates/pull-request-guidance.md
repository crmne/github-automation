## Pull requests

This section is maintained account-wide by
[crmne/github-automation](https://github.com/crmne/github-automation) and is
replaced when that policy changes. Do not edit it here. If it does not fit this
repository, say so in a review or issue, and put repository-specific rules in a
separate section, which takes precedence.

Review evidence stays out of the repository. Before-and-after screenshots,
captures, comparison pages, recordings, and anything else made to show
reviewers a change go in the pull request description or its comments: attach
the files there, or link a page published elsewhere. Only media the project
itself uses, such as documentation figures, release-note images, and app
assets, belongs in the repository.

Dependencies come from their package registry, such as crates.io, RubyGems, or
npm, or from repositories the maintainer controls, under `github.com/crmne/`
or this repository's own organization. A git dependency, or a patch, override,
or replace entry, may point only at such a repository, and adding or changing
one needs the maintainer's explicit approval. Never point a dependency at a
contributor's fork or any other source the maintainer does not control. When a
dependency needs a fix, send it upstream and ask the maintainer to carry it in
a fork they control until a release includes it.

Reviewers treat either problem in a pull request as a blocker.
